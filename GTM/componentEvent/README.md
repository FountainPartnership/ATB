ATB GTM tag review - componentEvent case study: link clicks

The ‘component event’ refers to a particular set of events in ATBs GA4 which is designed to capture multiple actions across the site with a single Google Tag Manager (GTM) tag. The documentation for the original build can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l_iHXbIUH1YmWrpy5nxmPXe3YAMQHvuDXWMvSBstwFc/edit#heading=h.ppbycvapp0kr

This directory contains a GTM export of the tags, triggers and virables for updating the existing GA4 event to be more GA4 friendly. The code for custom javascript variables has also been saved as individual files for quick reference.
